# Strucual-Engineering-Company-Website

  This project contains a structual engineering company website I created using mainly Bootstrap 4 with some CSS and Javascript. The main features of this website are:

    1) The homepage contains a background slide show that always fits to the screen size.

    2) The project page has a header filters to sort through the types of project the user want to see based on what type of structure the images are showing.

    3) The contact us section contains a google map that shows the company's location to the user.

# Todo Section

  1) See if I can fix the picture quality of some of the images to make them sharper and standout more
  
  2) Add an about us page that provide more detail about the company. This page would also need to have some cool bootstrap feature to make it stand out like the other pages.
